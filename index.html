<h2> Hello World!</h2>
<p1>I am Viviana Alvarez, a senior nursing major at Bob Jones University. I currently work at <a href="http://www.cfarestaurant.com/taylors/home">CFA in taylors </a> and All About Care part-time. At Chick-fil-A I work on boards which means, I make the orders the come up on screen and any other kitchen work. At <a href="https://www.allaboutcaresolutions.com/south-carolina"> All About Care SC </a> I work as a caregiver. We are sent to where ever a client needs us. You can divide our work into three categories: home health, hospice, and recovery. In home health our clientsâ€™ needs may vary from a helping around the house for chores to more hands on care as basic grooming and getting around. In recovery and hospice we are more sitters. Our main job is making sure the patient is comfortable and safe. I currently have an account at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/nhome/?trk="> Linkedin </a> under my name with my resume and experience. </p1>
<br>
<p2>As a Nursing student my schedule revolves mostly on my studies and clinicals. When I am not at school I am usually working. There are those rare occasions or that extra few minutes here and there that I have to myself. For fun I enjoy spending time with my family, usually.  When I am not with my family I am usually reading something. I love fiction. I usually have at least one book with me or at least a few are on my phone. I hope to graduate this year and join the World. </p2>
